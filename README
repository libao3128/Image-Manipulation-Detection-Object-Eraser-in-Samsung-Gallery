# Introduction
This is the image manipulation detection code for the [**Image Manipulation Detection-Object Eraser in Samsung Gallery**](https://hackmd.io/@libao3128/S1JOt7KO9) project.
# Usage
If you want to reproduce my result, you can change the **name** in filter.ipynb and the code will process on the image name.jpg in data/forgery/, data/real/ and data/mask/. The prediction result will be save in data/predic(if any).
If you want to use self-made dataset, please save the **real image** in data/real and save the **forgery image** in data/forgery and named both file in same name. And then, run the ground_truth.ipynb to produce the ground truth mask in data/mask. 
# Warning
